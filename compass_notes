# Starting the MongoDB Class, from MongoDB University.


Connecting to a MongoDB Database is pretty easy with mongo db compass. You just have to fill in the fields from the login. 


How to filter information - Basics

{"filter": "example"}

Side Note: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
	* always start and end with {}
	* JSON documents are composed of fields, which are composed of 2 values
		* key and value
		* Separated by a :
	* The key must always be in quotations ( {"key": 123123} )

Mongo DB generates the filters in a JSON style format. It requires you to select by which key do you want to filter, and the values from that filter that you want to see. It also allows you to have multiple queries at once, with range values, and your standard operations.
For example, let's take a look at the following filter
{'end station name': '8 Ave & W 33 St','birth year': {$gte: 1985,$lt: 1990}}
{'key for filter 1': 'value we want', 'key for filter 2': {values greater than 1985, values less than 1990 } }
$gte = Greater than or equal to 
$lt = less than
